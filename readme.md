Tkinter Designer was created to speed up the GUI-development process in Python. It uses the well-known design software [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to make creating beautiful Tkinter GUIs in Python a piece of cake.

Tkinter Designer uses the Figma API to analyse a design file and create the respective code and files needed for the GUI. Even Tkinter Designer's GUI is created using Tkinter Designer.

## 📐 How it Works
The only thing the user needs to do is design an interface with Figma, and then paste the Figma file URL and API token into Tkinter Designer.

Tkinter Designer will automatically generate all the code and images required to create the GUI in Tkinter.

## ✅ Figma Design Checklist (Also mentioned in the [PDF](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1uUuQfW11rAd4CwCm1nOGb-Qum2LpQybS))

* Background &mdash; should be named `Background` (in Figma)
* Buttons &mdash; should be named `Button` (in Figma)
   * When creating a button, add a Rectangle behind the actual button with the same color as the background color.
* Entry &mdash; should be named `TextBox` (in Figma)
* Rectangles &mdash; should be named `Rectangle` (in Figma)
* Text &mdash; All text in the design should be created as text.


Before converting a Figma file to Python code using Tkinter Designer, make sure that both the X &amp; Y coordinates of the frame are 0.
